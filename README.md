minesweeper-android
===================

First repo, first android-- go easy on me.

As of December 2014, I am a student at Santa Barbara City College, majoring in CS.

There is no executable file. If you have the Java SDK and an IDE, you should be able to "run" this by running mineSweeperAttempt.java class file.

This is a minesweeper game that I am developing with the help of a friend. 
It's starting out as a bare-basic minesweeper, without even a timer or a way of tracking how many mines are left. From there, the first intention is to clean it up, then get it set up in Android, adding features one by one from there.

The intention is to make a minesweeper that intuitively teaches someone how to play the game-- using a tutorial, hints, awards with progression, etc.
