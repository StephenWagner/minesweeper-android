minesweeper-android
===================

First repo, first android-- go easy on me.

As of December 2014, I am a student at Santa Barbara City College, majoring in CS.

This is a minesweeper game that I am developing with the help of a friend. It's starting out as a regular minesweeper, with the intention of making it an app that can also teach how to play the game.
